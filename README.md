# Sunset
A C++ engine for fun and education, using modern rendering features and light-weight data driven simulation systems, it is simple yet complete enough to allow you to bootstrap more ambitious games or projects. **macOS support is coming soon!**

## Getting Started
Just pull down the repository and run the included `build.bat` file at the root of the project.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gitbetter/Sunset.git
cd Sunset
./build.bat
```
You can then build and run the **SunsetDemo** target in the Visual Studio solution at `Sunset/engine/bin/Sunset.sln`!

If you encounter issues with missing `.SUN` files, make sure to build the **CookerRun** target first.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to install **[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)**, **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** and **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)** and make sure they are all locatable within your system **PATH** before running the build script as mentioned above!

## License
Sunset is available under the MIT License, and therefore anyone is free to fork the project and modify it as they wish so long as they maintain attributions to the original author of the project.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project (at which you have my many thanks), please fork and submit any pull requests you may have to the gold branch and not master, as it is easier for me to integrate changes selectively if need be.
